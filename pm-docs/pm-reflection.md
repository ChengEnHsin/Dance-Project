I came up with the idea for The Universal Language – Dance by thinking about how dance has shaped my own life and how powerful it is as a connector between cultures. Because my personal experience spans many styles and communities, I wanted to create a site that does more than simply describe dance. I imagined a space where users can watch examples, learn fun facts, and even find nearby studios. The idea grew from thinking about what kind of website would have inspired me when I first started dancing: something interactive, educational, and truly global.

The collaboration with my developer (Ann) worked well. I shared a clear vision of how each dance style should link to a YouTube example, what kind of tone the fun facts feature should have, and how the studio locator should function. My developer transformed these ideas into a structured website with multiple pages and interactive elements. The biggest challenge was balancing creativity with feasibility, since some ideas required technical adjustments, especially the dance video links, but consistent communication helped us make decisions that kept the project aligned and manageable.

Writing requirements taught me the importance of being specific about how users interact with the site. It was not enough to say that the site should show different dance styles. I had to explain what happens when a user clicks, what content appears, how pages should connect, and the overall feeling of the experience. I learned that requirements are more than a checklist. They are a guide for someone else to build from, so clarity and detail make a significant difference in how smoothly the development process goes.

I used AI tools throughout this process to refine my requirements and clarify feature descriptions when I struggled to put my ideas into words. AI helped me generate design ideas within my black, white, and dark red color palette and suggested technical approaches for the fun facts generator and the geolocation feature. Through this, I learned that AI is valuable for brainstorming and breaking features into actionable steps, but the creative vision and direction still needed to come from me.
