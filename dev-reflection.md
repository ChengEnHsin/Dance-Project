## How did you interpret and implement someone else’s idea?
I started by taking the core concept of “dance as a universal language” and translating it into a simple website structure that felt welcoming and easy to navigate. I broke the idea into clear sections like history, styles, fun facts, and embedded videos. I focused on designing the site so that the message came through visually and narratively, even if the original idea wasn’t mine.

## What were the challenges in development and collaboration?
The biggest challenge was turning broad creative ideas into something realistic to code as a beginner, especially with js and apis. Sometimes the design vision didn’t match what I could technically do yet, so I had to simplify layouts or try multiple versions in HTML and CSS. Collaborating also meant balancing different opinions and making sure the site stayed consistent in tone, visuals, and structure.


## Which parts did you use AI tools for, and what did you learn from that?
I used AI to help generate draft text for the history of dance, brainstorm content ideas, and get help troubleshooting HTML/CSS issues. I learned that AI is great for speeding up research and giving starting points, but I still had to revise everything to match my voice and my assignment requirements. It also taught me how important it is to understand the code myself so I can adjust it instead of relying on AI entirely.
