    <h1> The History of Dance</h1>
    <p>
      Dance is one of humanity’s oldest forms of expression, predating written 
      language and appearing in every culture on earth. From early ritual movements 
      around fires to communal celebrations that marked seasons, births, and 
      victories, dance began as a way for people to communicate stories and emotions
       without words. Archaeological evidence and ancient art show that even our 
       earliest ancestors understood rhythm as a universal connector that could unite 
       entire communities through shared movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As civilizations grew, so did dance. Egypt used it in spiritual ceremonies, 
      Greece embraced it in theatre, and India developed rich classical traditions
       filled with symbolic meaning. Across Africa, dance blended storytelling with
        complex rhythms. In the Americas, Indigenous communities used dance to honor
         nature, memory, and ancestry. Each culture shaped its own style, yet all used 
         dance for the same purpose: to express what the human heart feels when language 
         is not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, dance continues to evolve and reflect the world around us. Ballet, hip hop,
       contemporary, cultural folk traditions, and social dances all carry pieces of 
       the past while opening space for new creativity. Modern dancers mix techniques, 
       experiment with music, and use movement to build community both in person and 
       online. No matter the style or origin, dance remains a powerful reminder that 
       movement can cross borders, bridge differences, and speak directly to the human 
       spirit. It is a language every heart understands, everywhere.

    <h1>Fun Facts about Dance</h1>
     <ol class="dance-facts">
  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Dance is older than agriculture.</span>
  The earliest known depictions of dance appear in cave paintings from India and Spain that date back more than 8,000 years.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Ancient cultures used dance as a form of record keeping.</span>
  In many Indigenous societies, key events, myths, and histories were preserved through structured dances rather than written text.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Ballet was originally created for royalty, not performers.</span>
  In the 16th century, members of the French and Italian courts danced in their own elaborate productions long before professional ballet dancers existed.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Some West African dance rhythms layer multiple beats at once.</span>
  This polyrhythmic structure trains dancers to move each limb to a different rhythm, making the choreography both artistic and mathematically complex.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Classical Indian Bharatanatyam has a movement alphabet.</span>
  Each gesture of the hand, eye, and face carries symbolic meaning, allowing dancers to tell full stories with an intricate physical vocabulary.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Tap dance emerged from cultural blending under hardship.</span>
  African rhythmic footwork fused with Irish step dancing in crowded American cities, creating a uniquely expressive shared art form.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Contemporary dance grew out of rebellion.</span>
  Early pioneers rejected the rigid rules of ballet and embraced natural, expressive movement that later influenced modern art and performance styles.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Tango was once considered too scandalous.</span>
  When the dance first reached Europe in the early 1900s, its close and improvisational style led many ballrooms to ban it entirely.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Hip hop began as a cultural ecosystem.</span>
  Early dancers were part of a larger creative movement that included DJs, MCs, graffiti artists, and community block parties in the Bronx.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="fact-title">Dancers often jump higher relative to body weight than many athletes.</span>
  Years of training in explosive power and precise landings give elite dancers vertical capabilities that rival high-level basketball and volleyball players.
  </li>
